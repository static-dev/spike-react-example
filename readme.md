# Spike React Example

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/static-dev/spike-react-example.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is [the react tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html), but you can work with it in spike instead of a codepen. Also a good basic example of how to configure spike to work with react.

## Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is at version >= `6`
- `npm i spike -g`
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `spike watch` or `spike compile`

## Testing
Tests are located in `test/**` and are powered by [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava)
- `npm install` to ensure devDeps are installed
- `npm test` to run test suite
