# Spike React Example

This is a base for [the react tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html), but you can work with it in spike instead of a codepen. Also a good basic example of how to configure spike to work with react.

Check out the [finished branch](https://github.com/static-dev/spike-react-example/tree/finished) to see the react tutorial fully implemented.
